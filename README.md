# Shader Shakedown at ITP CAMP

## Description

An overview of advanced graphics programming skills using OpenGL/WebGL Shading Language to modify the rendering pipeline. We will only cover GLSL version 1.0 and will focus on fragment shaders. 

We will use Processing as well as glslEditor, an online tool that was created alongside The Book of Shaders (http://editor.thebookofshaders.com).  

The things you learn here will be applicable to: Processing, p5.js, openFrameworks, Cinder, Three.js, Shadertoy and more.   

Some of the more complex mathematics we encounter will be left as exercises for you due to our relatively short amount of time. Don't be discouraged if you feel out of your comfort zone, you will still be able to play around with things. :)

## Tentative Outline
0. **Presentation** - Some talking about shaders

1. **Setup** - How do we even use this shader thing?

2. **Shaping Functions** - Using the builtin functions

3. **Color** - How to handle color in GLSL

4. **Shapes** - Making Shapes in GLSL

5. **Patterns** - Combining
